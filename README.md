# TechDegree-Project-2
 List Pagination and Filtering
 
 This project will accept a list of students and divide the list into multiple pages.  Each page will have 10 students on it.  Only those pages needed for displaying the students will be created.
 
 Pages will display dynamically with vanilla JavaScript upon clicking the generated links at the bottom of the page.
 
 A search box will be dynamically created with JavaScript and will dynamically change the students displayed using the text entered in the search field.
